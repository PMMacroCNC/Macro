# Macro
A macro is a file which contains a sequence of commands to  automate recurrent operations. You can create macros by recording  operations as they occur in PowerMILL, or by entering the  commands directly into a text editor. Recorded macros have a .mac  extension, and can be run from the Macro node in the Explorer
